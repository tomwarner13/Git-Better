# Git-Better
Useful Git Shell Aliases and Shortcuts

## Installation

- Add the code in .bashrc into your .bashrc file, or use it to create one if you don't have one yet.
- Run `source ~/.bashrc` or restart your shell client to pick up the changes.
- Add the code from .gitconfig to your git config file -- you should be able to edit it by running `git config -e --global` in your shell.

For the curious, I wrote up further documentation about these aliases and the reasoning behind them in a [blog post](https://biologicalspeculation.blog/43658/git-learnt).
